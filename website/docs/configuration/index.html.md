  Terraform uses text files to describe infrastructure and to set variables.
  These text files are called Terraform _configurations_ and are
  written in the Terraform language.

# Configuration

Terraform uses its own configuration language, designed to allow concise
descriptions of infrastructure. The Terraform language is declarative,
describing an intended goal rather than the steps to reach that goal.

## Resources and Modules

The main purpose of the Terraform language is declaring [resources](/docs/configuration/resources.html).
All other language features exist only to make the definition of resources
more flexible and convenient.

A group of resources can be gathered into a [module](/docs/configuration/modules.html),
which creates a larger unit of configuration. A resource describes a single
infrastructure object, while a module might describe a set of objects and the
necessary relationships between them in order to create a higher-level system.

A _Terraform configuration_ consists of a _root module_, where evaluation
begins, along with a tree of child modules created when one module references
another.

## Code Organization

The Terraform language uses configuration files that are named with the `.tf`
file extension. There is also [a JSON-based variant of the language](/docs/configuration/syntax-json.html)
that is named with the `.tf.json` file extension.

Configuration files must always use UTF-8 encoding, and by convention are
usually maintained with Unix-style line endings (LF) rather than Windows-style
line endings (CRLF), though both are accepted.

A _module_ is a collection of `.tf` or `.tf.json` files kept together in a
directory. The root module is built from the configuration files in the
current working directory when Terraform is run, and this module may reference
child modules in other directories, which can in turn reference other modules,
etc.

The simplest Terraform configuration is a single root module containing only
a single `.tf` file. A configuration can grow gradually as more resources
are added, either by creating new configuration files within the root module
or by organizing sets of resources into child modules.

## Configuration Ordering

Because Terraform's configuration language is declarative, the ordering of
blocks is generally not significant, except in some specific situations which
are described explicitly elsewhere.

Terraform automatically processes resources in the correct order based on
relationships defined between them in configuration, and so you can organize
resources into source files in whatever way makes sense for your infrastructure.

## Terraform Core vs. Providers

Terraform Core is a general engine for evaluating and applying Terraform
configuations. It defines the Terraform language syntax and overall structure,
and coordinates sequences of changes that must be made to make remote
infrastructure match the given configuration.

Terraform Core has no knowledge of specific infrastructure object types, though.
Instead, Terraform uses plugins called [providers](/docs/configuration/providers.html)
that each define and know how to manage a set of resource types. Most providers
are associated with a particular cloud or on-premises infrastructure service,
allowing Terraform to manage infrastructure objects within that service.

Since each provider has its own resource types with different features, the
exact details of resources can vary between services, but Terraform Core
ensures that the same language constructs and syntax are available across
all services and allows resource types from different services to be combined
as needed.

## Example

The following simple example describes a simple network topology for Amazon Web
Services, just to give a sense of the overall structure and syntax of the
Terraform language. Similar configurations can be created for other virtual
network services, using resource types defined by other providers, and a
practical network configuration will often contain additional elements not
shown here.

```hcl
variable "aws_region" {}

variable "base_cidr_block" {
  description = "A /16 CIDR range definition, such as 10.1.0.0/16, that the VPC will use"
  default = "10.1.0.0/16"
}

variable "availability_zones" {
  description = "A list of availability zones in which to create subnets"
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  # Referencing the base_cidr_block variable allows the network address
  # to be changed without modifying the configuration.
  cidr_block = var.base_cidr_block
}

resource "aws_subnet" "az" {
  # Create one subnet for each given availability zone.
  count = length(var.availability_zones)

  # For each subnet, use one of the specified availability zones.
  availability_zone = var.availability_zones[count.index]

  # By referencing the aws_vpc.main object, Terraform knows that the subnet
  # must be created only after the VPC is created.
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  # Built-in functions and operators can be used for simple transformations of
  # values, such as computing a subnet address. Here we create a /20 prefix for
  # each subnet, using consecutive addresses for each availability zone,
  # such as 10.1.16.0/20 .
  cidr_block = cidrsubnet(aws_vpc.main.cidr_block, 4, count.index+1)
}
```
